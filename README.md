#Web Search Engine
This application is built using JAVA, JS, BootStrap and Jquery. 
The Application consists of below functionalities: 
1. Web Crawler - which is gathering the string tokens from a URL recursively. Currently, we have limited the scope of URL crawling to be 10,000. But can easily be changed. 
2. Inverted Index - We have used the inverted Index to store the Data Dictionary from Web Crawler Output. This is implemented using Trie(for Data Dictionary) and HashMap(Occurrences of Strings in a URL). 
3. Ranking of Webpages: QuickSelect Algorithm is used to rank the top 5 web pages for the searched String.
 4. Autocompletion of words using Trie.
 5. Correct Word recommendation using EDIT Distance Algorithm. Currently, we are recommending the words from Data Dictionary which are 1 edit distance away from the User's Searched word.
